# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon build error encountered with Expo CLI. The error is not consistently reported, making it difficult to diagnose. This example focuses on a scenario where the build process fails due to conflicts or incompatibility with native modules.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Attempt to build the app using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`.

## Expected Behavior
A successful build that produces an APK (Android) or IPA (iOS) file.

## Actual Behavior
A build failure with an ambiguous error message from Expo CLI.

## Solution
The solution provided involves updating Expo CLI, checking for conflicting packages, and ensuring that native modules are properly configured.  The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code and build process.
