The solution often involves several steps:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI. Run `npm install -g expo-cli` to update.
2. **Check Package Dependencies:** Carefully review your `package.json` file. Look for any conflicting or outdated packages that might interfere with the build process.  Try `npm install` again after reviewing.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes a clean rebuild resolves the issue. Try `expo prebuild` to remove existing build artifacts before running `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`.
4. **Native Module Configuration:** If you're using native modules, verify that they are properly configured and compatible with your Expo version. Consult the documentation of the native module.
5. **Examine Logs:** Carefully examine the complete build logs; there might be more detailed error messages hidden within the output that point towards a specific problem. 
6. **Eject (Last Resort):** If all else fails, consider ejecting from Expo managed workflow to Expo bare workflow (though this is generally avoided unless absolutely necessary).  Ejecting gives you more control but comes with increased complexity.
